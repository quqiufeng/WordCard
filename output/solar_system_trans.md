## 原文

The solar [system] consists of the Sun and
everything that orbits, or [travels] around, the
Sun. This includes the eight [planets] and their
moons, dwarf [planets], and [countless]
[asteroids], comets, and other small icy
[objects]. The solar [system] extends about two
light-years from the Sun, marking the outer
[boundary] where the Sun's [gravitational]
influence ends. At the center of our solar
[system] is the Sun, a giant star that produces
enormous amounts of energy through nuclear fusion.
The Sun contains 99.86% of the solar [system]'s
total mass and provides the light and heat
necessary for life on Earth. Without the Sun's
[gravitational] pull, the [planets] would drift
aimlessly through space. The eight [planets] are
divided into two main categories. The four inner
[planets]—[mercury], Venus, Earth, and Mars—are
terrestrial [planets] with solid, rocky surfaces.
These [planets] are relatively small and close to
the Sun. [mercury] is the smallest and fastest
[planet], completing an orbit in just 88 Earth
days. Venus is the hottest [planet] due to its
thick atmosphere that traps heat. Earth is the only
[planet] known to support life, while Mars has
attracted scientific interest for its potential to
harbor life. Beyond Mars lies the [asteroid]
belt, a [region] [containing] [millions] of
rocky [objects]. This belt marks the [boundary]
between the inner and outer [planets]. The
[asteroids] range in size from tiny [particles]
to Ceres, the [largest] object in the belt and
the only dwarf [planet] in the inner solar
[system]. The four outer [planets]—[jupiter],
Saturn, [uranus], and [neptune]—are much larger
than the inner [planets]. [jupiter] is the
[largest] [planet] in our solar [system],
with a mass more than twice that of all other
[planets] combined. It features the Great Red
Spot, a storm that has raged for centuries. Saturn
is famous for its spectacular ring [system],
composed mainly of ice [particles]. [uranus]
and [neptune], the most [distant] [planets],
are ice giants with frigid temperatures. [uranus]
rotates on its side, while [neptune] has the
strongest winds in the solar [system]. Beyond
[neptune] lies the Kuiper Belt, a donut-shaped
[region] [containing] [countless] icy bodies.
This [region] is similar to the [asteroid] belt
but much larger. Pluto, once considered the ninth
[planet], is now classified as a dwarf [planet]
in the Kuiper Belt. Each [planet] [travels] in
an elliptical orbit around the Sun, following the
laws of gravity discovered by Isaac Newton. Earth
completes one orbit in exactly 365.25 days,
defining our year. The outer [planets] take much
longer—[neptune], the most [distant], requires
about 165 Earth years to complete one orbit. The
solar [system] formed approximately 4.6 billion
years ago from a giant cloud of gas and dust. Over
[millions] of years, this material slowly
collapsed under its own gravity, forming the Sun
and the surrounding protoplanetary disk from which
the [planets] eventually emerged. Today,
scientists continue to explore our solar [system]
using spacecraft and telescopes. Missions like
Voyager have sent back remarkable images of
[distant] worlds, while Mars rovers search for
signs of ancient life. Understanding our solar
[system] helps us appreciate both the fragility
and resilience of our home [planet].
