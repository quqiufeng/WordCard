TITLE: The Solar System: Our Cosmic Neighborhood

ORIGINAL:
The solar system consists of the Sun and everything that orbits,
or travels around, the Sun. This includes the eight planets and
their moons, dwarf planets, and countless asteroids, comets, and
other small icy objects. The solar system extends about two
light-years from the Sun, marking the outer boundary where the
Sun's gravitational influence ends.
At the center of our solar system is the Sun, a giant star that
produces enormous amounts of energy through nuclear fusion. The
Sun contains 99.86% of the solar system's total mass and
provides the light and heat necessary for life on Earth. Without
the Sun's gravitational pull, the planets would drift aimlessly
through space.
The eight planets are divided into two main categories. The four
inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are terrestrial
planets with solid, rocky surfaces. These planets are relatively
small and close to the Sun. Mercury is the smallest and fastest
planet, completing an orbit in just 88 Earth days. Venus is the
hottest planet due to its thick atmosphere that traps heat.
Earth is the only planet known to support life, while Mars has
attracted scientific interest for its potential to harbor life.
Beyond Mars lies the asteroid belt, a region containing millions
of rocky objects. This belt marks the boundary between the inner
and outer planets. The asteroids range in size from tiny
particles to Ceres, the largest object in the belt and the only
dwarf planet in the inner solar system.
The four outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are
much larger than the inner planets. Jupiter is the largest
planet in our solar system, with a mass more than twice that of
all other planets combined. It features the Great Red Spot, a
storm that has raged for centuries. Saturn is famous for its
spectacular ring system, composed mainly of ice particles.
Uranus and Neptune, the most distant planets, are ice giants
with frigid temperatures. Uranus rotates on its side, while
Neptune has the strongest winds in the solar system.
Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, a donut-shaped region
containing countless icy bodies. This region is similar to the
asteroid belt but much larger. Pluto, once considered the ninth
planet, is now classified as a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt.
Each planet travels in an elliptical orbit around the Sun,
following the laws of gravity discovered by Isaac Newton. Earth
completes one orbit in exactly 365.25 days, defining our year.
The outer planets take much longer—Neptune, the most distant,
requires about 165 Earth years to complete one orbit.
The solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from
a giant cloud of gas and dust. Over millions of years, this
material slowly collapsed under its own gravity, forming the Sun
and the surrounding protoplanetary disk from which the planets
eventually emerged.
Today, scientists continue to explore our solar system using
spacecraft and telescopes. Missions like Voyager have sent back
remarkable images of distant worlds, while Mars rovers search
for signs of ancient life. Understanding our solar system helps
us appreciate both the fragility and resilience of our home
planet.
